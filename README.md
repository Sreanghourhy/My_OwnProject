## Music Player with YouTube Integration

This project is a music player built with React that integrates YouTube videos for streaming lofi music. The player features a dynamic playlist with seasonal themes, allowing users to switch between different tracks by clicking on their preferred options. Each track plays a unique YouTube live stream video, and the player automatically moves to the next track once the current one ends. The application includes a custom player that utilizes the `react-youtube` library, providing smooth playback controls (play/pause) and volume management. The player is designed with a clean user interface, featuring season-themed banners and animated GIFs to enhance the listening experience. The responsive layout ensures compatibility with various screen sizes, making it suitable for both mobile and desktop users.
